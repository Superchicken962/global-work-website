<button type="button" class="collapsible">How was the prison different to what you were used to elsewhere?</button>
<div class="content">
<p>A prisoner had remembered having
  soft beds and washed sheets
  but in the prison they had to
  use straw mattresses
  and hard beds. The prisons apparently
  had reused the materials used for healing
  the wounds. These materials were supposed
  to be white, but were mostly brown from
  all the people that had their wounds healed.

<p>A paragraph from an ex prisoner from 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0786-8_7">ttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0786-8_7</a>, states that in one army camp, their room was pretty much pitch black. The windows had been covered using sheets of metal which had holes drilled into them to let just enough light into the room. It often got hot in the room because of the steel, and the ex-prisoner stated that it almost killed them of how hot it was.
