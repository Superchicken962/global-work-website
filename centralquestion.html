<div class="center-text">
<h2>The Central question for this Inquiry project is...</h2>
<h1><strong>Did the prison conditions affect the prisoner's mental and<br>physical wellbeing and welfare and how did it effect them.</strong></h1>
<br>
<h1><strong>Answer:</strong></h1><h2 class="cqanswer">The prison conditions were harsh and poor, and often lead to the prisoners having a poor mental state and physical state.
    Such conditions, stated by <a href="https://anzacportal.dva.gov.au/wars-and-missions/ww1/personnel/australian-pows"><strong>anzacportal.dva.gov.au</strong></a>, included: 80 people being crammed into rooms fit for 30, bug infestations and the rations were usually just loafs of bread.
    One prisoner, from <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0786-8_7"><strong>link.springer.com</strong></a>, said that the rooms they were kept in were poor and that their were steel sheets used on the windows to keep their rooms dark with small holes to let tiny amounts of light in. The soldier also stated that the sheets would get hot and would "almost kill" him.
